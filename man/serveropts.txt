OPTIONS
-------

-p, --pidfile pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. By default the daemons use dbmail-<daemon>.pid
  for their pid files, saving them in the directory specified by the
  pid_directory entry in dbmail.conf or if that does not exist the value set by
  the configuration option --localstatedir, and will halt if the pid file
  cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to place the pid file in
  your system's preferred location.

-n, --no-daemon::
  No daemonize: inetd mode. The program remains attached to the console from
  which it was started and will read and write on stdin/stdout. This is useful
  for debugging when combined with the -v option. It is also used for running
  from (x)inetd.

-D, --inetd::
  No daemonize: The program remains attached to the console and will listen on
  the network sockets defined in dbmail.conf.
  This is mostly used for xinetd (Extended Internet Service Daemon)
