DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-util program offers a database cleanup and integrity check.
All messages set for deletion (status 2) will be marked for final deletion
(status 3). All message marked for final deletion will be cleared from the
database. The integrity check will check for unconnected mimeparts,
headervalues, messages and mailboxes.

By default, checks are read-only. Pass the --no option to respond no to any
prompts. Pass the --yes option to make read-write changes, responding yes to
any prompts.

OPTIONS
-------

-b, --check-body::
 Check and rebuild the body/header/envelope cache tables.

-d, --set-deleted::
 Queue all messages marked with the DELETE (2) status for final purging, by 
 setting the status value to PURGE (3). The status field is set to DELETE by
 either the IMAP-EXPUNGE or POP3-DELE commands.

-p, --purge-deleted::
 Remove all messages with a PURGE (3) value on status field. To purge messages
 currently marked with the DELETE (2) status, run with the -pd options twice.
 This is not recommended; it is better to leave a grace period for old messages
 before permanently wiping them from the database.

-s, --remove-invalid-aliases::
 Remove dangling/invalid aliases and forwards.

-t, --test-integrity::
 Test for message integrity.

-a, --all-checks::
 Perform the above checks: --check-body --set-deleted --purge-deleted
 --remove-invalid-aliases --test-integrity

-r, --clear-replycache time::
 Clear the reply cache used for autoreplies and Sieve vacations. The time is
 specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

-l, --clear-iplog time::
 Clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP-before-SMTP. The time is specified as
 <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

--rehash::
 Rebuild hash keys for stored messages

--erase days::
 Delete messages older than date in INBOX/Trash

--move days::
 Move messages from INBOX to INBOX/Trash

--inbox name::
 Inbox folder to move from, used in conjunction with --move

--trash name::
 Trash folder to move to, used in conjunction with --move

*Common options*

-n, --no::
 Show the intended repairs without making any changes, i.e. no to all.

-y, --yes::
 Perform all repair actions , i.e. yes to all.

*Maintenance options*

--rehash::
 Rebuild the hash values for all the message parts in the database. You
 need to run this after modifying the hash_algorithm config option.

-e, --check-empty-cache::
 Check for empty envelope cache.

*Migration options*

-M, --migrate-legacy limit::
 migrate legacy 2.2.x messageblks to mimeparts table.

-m, --migrate-limit limit::

Regular maintenance can be run as a regular cron job:

`    dbmail-util --all --yes --verbose`

To set all messages with the DELETE status to PURGE status, and permanently
remove all messages previously set to PURGE status:

`    dbmail-util --set-deleted --purge-deleted -yes`


To get a listing of the changes that would be performed for all actions:

`    dbmail-util --all --no`


To remove all IP log entries more than three days old:

`    dbmail-util --clear-iplog 72h --yes`


After upgrading from DBMail 2.0 or truncating the cache tables, run this command
to populate the cache:

`    dbmail-util --check-body --yes`
