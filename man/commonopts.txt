COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
-f, --config configfile::
 Specify an alternate config file. +
 Use dbmail-<utility> --help to show the default location.

-q, --quiet::
 Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages
 which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two -q's to
 silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.

-v, --verbose::
 Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite
 can take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand
 this convention won't complain about having the extra -v
 and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

-V, --version::
 Show the version and copyright, then exit.

-h, --help::
 Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
